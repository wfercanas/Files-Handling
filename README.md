2. **isFile/**: Check if a given path is a regular file.
3. **isDirectory/**: Check if a given path is a directory.
4. **readFull/**: Read a complete file at once .
5. **readByLine/**: Read a file line by line.
6. **readByWord/**: Read a file word by word.
7. **readByChar/**: Read a file character by character.
8. **createFile/**: Program for creating a new file.
9. **copyFile/**: Program to create a new file as a copy of another one.
10. **writeFile/**: Program for creating a file and writing some data within.
11. **appendData/**: Program for adding some new data in an existing file.
12. **catData/**: Program for printing on the terminal the content of a file.

## Accessories

You can always use the _./tmp/data.txt_ file when testing the programs.

## Recommendations

If you are beginning to learn Go, I recommend you to first check the basic Golang repos I have built to lay the foundation. Then come back and check these programs:

- [Basic Go - I](https://github.com/wfercanas/Basic-Golang-I)
- [Basic Go - II](https://github.com/wfercanas/Basic-Golang-II)
